        <p> Hi there! My name is Jing, and I am currently a second-year student at Northeastern University, 
            pursuing a combined major in Data Science and Mathematics. I have a strong passion for leveraging 
            mathematical techniques to analyze data and solve complex business problems. 
        </p>
        <p> Last semester, I worked as an office assistant at my university's Clinical Placement Office, 
            where I managed and entered data for over 100 students using Excel. My responsibilities included 
            tracking student status, ensuring data accuracy, and improving the efficiency of student records management. 
            This experience strengthened my organizational and analytical skills, reinforcing my interest in working with data. 
        </p>        
        <p> Currently, I am enrolled in Machine Learning and Statistics courses to deepen my understanding of model building 
            and its mathematical foundations. My career interests lie in data analytics and actuarial science. I am considering 
            becoming an actuary, though I have not yet decided whether to pursue credentials from the Society of Actuaries (SOA) 
            or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). This decision will likely depend on my future employer and whether they 
            specialize in life insurance or property and casualty insurance. In the meantime, I am preparing for my first 
            actuarial exam—the Probability exam—which I am scheduled to take in March. 
        </p>
