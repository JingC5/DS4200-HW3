        <p> Actuarial science is a specialized field that applies mathematics, statistics, and 
            financial theory to analyze and manage financial risks. It plays a crucial role in 
            industries such as insurance, pensions, investments, and risk management. 
            Actuaries—professionals trained in this discipline—use mathematical models to predict 
            future events and assess the financial impact of uncertainties. Their work helps 
            businesses, governments, and organizations make well-informed decisions to maintain 
            financial stability and long-term sustainability. 
        </p>
        <p> One of the primary roles of an actuary is to analyze risks associated with uncertain 
            future events, such as accidents, natural disasters, illnesses, or economic downturns. 
            By evaluating historical data and applying probability theory, actuaries can estimate 
            the likelihood of these events occurring and develop strategies to minimize financial 
            losses. For example, in the insurance industry, actuaries determine premium rates by 
            assessing the risk levels of different policyholders. In pension planning, they forecast 
            future payouts to ensure funds remain solvent over time. 
        </p>
        <p> Becoming an actuary requires a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, and economics.
            In addition to academic knowledge, actuaries must pass a series of rigorous professional 
            exams offered by organizations like the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial 
            Society (CAS). These exams cover topics such as probability, financial mathematics, 
            risk modeling, and regulations.
